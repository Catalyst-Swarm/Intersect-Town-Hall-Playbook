October to December was a challenging months in the sense of a lot of competing events and holidays, but I think we have proved that people will find time to join.

Overall, the Town Hall participation average has dropped nearly 40% compared to the last 4 months' average.

We had a total of 84 unique participants visit the Town Hall across this 4-month period. A drop of 26% compared to the last 4 months.

Throughout Town Halls, it's visible that that we have a low retention rate.\
We constantly get new members to join each Town Hall and some people rejoin after a few months, but growth is not visible in the long term.
