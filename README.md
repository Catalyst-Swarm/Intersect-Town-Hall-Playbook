## **A Connected Experience**

Publicity, planning and community research&#x20;

Swarm facilitate these Town Halls and After Town Halls every month, making them a connected experience. This means we coordinated the publicity, planning, and community research together. Our goal was to create Town Halls that are engaging, welcoming, well-publicized, and truly participatory.

Intersect Town Hall happened every fourth Thursday in the month at 16:00 UTC

## **Swarm’s Town Hall History**&#x20;

We start them, support them and hand them over.&#x20;

Now, a little bit about our history. Swarm has a solid track record of kickstarting Town Halls in various communities. We provide the initial support, knowledge, and mentorship needed, and then we step back to let the community take over. We've successfully done this in places like Project Catalyst in Africa, Latam, the Eastern Hemisphere, Europe, and the Pacific regions. Also, we've worked with SingularityNET’s Ambassador Program and DeepFunding Program. We typically take about 7 to 10 months to get things rolling, which fits perfectly with the time frame of this grant.

## **Open Town Hall Working Group**&#x20;

To engage the wider Intersect community in Town Hall planning, we ran two open workshops per month. These workshops were for anyone in the Intersect community who wanted to get involved in Co-Creation and Operations for Intersect Town Halls.

## **Tracking Topics, Contributions, Decisions and Ideas.**&#x20;

Town Hall and After Town Hall content becomes an Intersect community asset.&#x20;

One of our key goals was to make sure all the topics, contributions, decisions, and ideas that come up during the Town Halls and After Town Halls are well-documented. This way, everything becomes a valuable community asset.&#x20;

## **Town Hall Playbook**&#x20;

Build a baseline and iterate on it&#x20;

We have kept this Town Hall Playbook up to date. This will give us a solid baseline to work from and improve upon.
