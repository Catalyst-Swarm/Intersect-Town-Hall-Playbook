### Swarm Team Stand-Up Session

This Session is intended to:

* Review and distribute project tasks based on current WG capacity.
* Validate task documentation and evidence to move tasks for payment.
* Discuss any other Intersect Town Hall related topics

The review of tasks/decisions and the project board stand-up are recorded for ease of transparent and accountable reporting.

### Intersect Town Hall

Town Hall is a regular meeting for a community to&#x20;

* come together
* share updates
* discuss important issues

It’s somewhere where you can reach many people at once from all sections of your community.&#x20;

It’s an open space where anyone can stand up and share something, but there’s a structure in the form of different “slots” where community members can bring content.\


It’s shaped by the community it serves; so what it’s like, depends on who’s there.

### Intersect After Town Hall

After Town Hall is an informal, community-led event that happens immediately after a Town Hall.&#x20;

It consists of a series of breakout rooms, each facilitated by a community member, about a topic of interest to them - for example

* sharing something they’re working on
* or discussing an issue they care about

The breakout rooms take place simultaneously and Town Hall attendees choose which one to attend.&#x20;



Anyone can sign up to run one, and can run it in whatever style they like.&#x20;

The Swarm Town Hall team can offer support with planning, facilitating or documenting -&#x20;

just let us know in the form!

## Communication Plan

For asynchronous work, we use various platforms:

* Intersect Discord Server - Intersect Town Hall Channel
  * You can find all Town Hall related updates or requests here first

* Emails - Coordinate with Intersect Members who prefer different communication methods other than Discord

### Messaging Strategy
